# Refactorings
First refactoring done using **Branch And Merge**
- Bad code smell: Long class
- How did the refactoring make the code better: it is now easier to follow along, all the different methods to create a specific Object are in a different class called ObjectBuilder.

Next, I have performed multiple smaller refactorings, such as name changes and Extract Method (creating printHeader())
- Bad code smell: Long method
- After the refactoring, the method and variable names are more clear, and easier to follow along.
