# Refactorings
First refactoring done using **Branch And Merge**, can be seen in [this](https://gitlab.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/tebeica.teodor1/cpsc501a3/-/commit/e35f15da5f1dca563704522d54efe8f26f67edef) commmit.
- Bad code smell: Long class
- How did the refactoring make the code better: it is now easier to follow along, all the different methods to create a specific Object are in a different class called ObjectBuilder.

Next, I have performed multiple smaller refactorings, such as name changes and Extract Method (creating printHeader()), can be seen in [this](https://gitlab.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/tebeica.teodor1/cpsc501a3/-/commit/1047aac44de417697b7b59fa03c1d15ec06890e8) commit.
- Bad code smell: Long method
- After the refactoring, the method and variable names are more clear, and easier to follow along.
